#### 2.1. Issues

- the password reset URL should not be reusable
  - attacker gets access to email to reset password using an old password-reset URL
  - once used, the password-reset URL should become invalid (server-side validation)
  - multiple (concurrent) password reset URLs are allowed for one user; this may lead to race condition issues

- password-reset URL might link to an HTTP page, instead of HTTPS
  - attacker can intercept the URL sent over-clear text

- password reset does not contain captcha
  - password reset (forgot password) can be used to enumerate users
  - attacker can automate the password-reset functionality
  - may require social engineering angle to perform this attack (2FA bypass, etc.)

- password reuse is allowed on the website 
  - if subject can reuse the same password as the new one it's prone to compromise (leaked databases)

- account identifiers present in the password reset URL (JWT, or similar)
  - attacker try to modify those identifiers to reset the password for other users based on a valid token

- password reset URL is available for a long period of time
  - allows cryptographic attacks on the password-reset token
  - some sites give you a 24h to use the password reset URL
