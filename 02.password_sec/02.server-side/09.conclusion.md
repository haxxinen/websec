#### 9.1. Key points

- sensitive data must be kept secret for both ends (client-server)
- hashing can be used for
  a. generating password hashes (password "fingerprints‚Äù)
  b. file checksum computation (file integrity)
- always use strong crypto hashing functions (bcrypt, scrypt, etc.)
- make sure the system will analyze the entropy of the user-supplied password (upon user account registration)
- environmental variables are a better place to store your application secrets than source-code (avoid use of hardcoded credentials)


#### 9.2. Salting

- append/prepend passwords with crypto-secure random string 
- make sure the hashing library does salting by default
- if you cannot use strong hashing functions (Bcrypt, Argon2), safely place a secret static salt on application level and use it with fast hashing (SHA512/Whirlpool)


#### 9.3. Hash cracking attacks

- dictionary attack
- hash collision attacks
- rainbow-tables
- locker brute-force
