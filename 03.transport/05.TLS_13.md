#### 5.1. TLS/1.3 improvements

- faster handshake
  - TLS/1.2 - 2 round-trips
  - TLS/1.3 - 1 round-trip
- 0-RTT (Zero Round Trip Time)
  - send data with the first message sent to a previously visited website
  - known as TLS resumption (send encrypted data with the first packet)
- removes outdated/confusing/insecure crypto functions from TLS/1.2
  - hashing: MD5/SHA-1
  - encryption: DES/3DES/AES-CBC/RC4
  - patches for CVE-2016-0701/CVE-2015-0204
- less prone to misconfiguration


#### 5.2. Future support

- by March 2020 Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla will deprecate TLS/1.0 and TLS/1.1
- TLS/1.2 is still the most mature and reliable option for transport security (for Jan 2019)
- TLS/1.3 is the way forward since August 2018
- TLS/1.3 and HTTP/2.0 will go hand in hand for a faster web
- only a matter of time till TLS/1.3 will suppress most TLS configurations (except v1.2)


#### 5.3. TLS/1.3 browser (client) support

- stable on Chrome >=70 - October 2018
- stable on Firefox >=63 - October 2018
- stable on Safari >=11.1
- more details here: `https://caniuse.com/#feat=tls1-3`


#### 5.4. TLS/1.2 server support

- Cloudflare announced in Sept 2018 that TLS/1.3 surpassed TLS 1.0 (as 2nd most used version)
- Akamai supports TLS/1.3
- can be configured on all mature web-servers


#### 5.5. TLS/1.2 handshake

````
               client hello
01. CLIENT -------------------> SERVER

                server hello
                certificate
            server key exchange
             server hello done
02. CLIENT <------------------- SERVER

             
           client key exchange
           change cipher spec
                finished
03. CLIENT -------------------> SERVER

           
            change cipher spec
                finished
04. CLIENT <------------------- SERVER
````


#### 5.6. TLS/1.3 handshake

```
                   client hello
             supported cipher suites
           guess key agreement protocol
                    key share
01. CLIENT ---------------------------> SERVER

                   server hello
               key agreement protocol
                     key share
                  server finished
02. CLIENT <--------------------------- SERVER

                 checks certificate
                   generates keys
                  client finished
03. CLIENT ---------------------------> SERVER
```
