#### 1.1. Intro

- encrypt web traffic using public-key cryptography
- HTTP + TLS/SSL = HTTPS (HTTP server must support TLS/SSL)
- TLS: `Transport Layer Security`
- SSL: `Secure Sockets Layer`
- TLS/SSL can also be configured at TCP layer (w/o HTTP)
- requires a pair of RSA keys (public/private; min RSA-2048 bits)
  - deployed on the server
  - self-signed certificates will show browser warning (SSL certificate is not trusted / unless installed in the trust store)

#### 1.2. Current status

```

| SSL 3.0 |    1996    | since 2015       |
| TLS 1.0 |    1999    | planned in 2020  |
| TLS 1.1 |    2006    | planned in 2020  |
| TLS 1.2 |    2008    | no               |

#### 1.3. SSL/TLS handshake

1. client-server info exchange:
   - SSL version no.
   - cipher settings
   - session data
   - server sends SSL certificate to client (RSA public key)

2. client validates SSL certificate info
   - are the cert dates valid? (not valid before/after)
   - what CA (certificate authority) issued the SSL cert.?
   - if CA is not in the ROOT/trusted certificate store (browser/OS level),
     the user is warned about this (self-signed certificate? YOLO)

[encrypted communication begins here - only if client validation is successful]

3. client-server exchange public-private keys to securely establish the SSL session key
   - steps in order 
     a. asymmetric key (public key cryptography)
     b. symmetric key = session key (depends on cipher strength, preferred by the server and supported by browser)
   - perfect forward secrecy
     - you cannot break `b.` unless you break `a.`
     - if you break one layer of crypto you don't break the entire communication system
     - even if the private key of the server is compromised you still need to break every session key

4. final client-server handshake message
   - begin encrypted session (encrypted with symmetric key)


#### 1.4. CA = Certificate Authority

- client authenticates server based on the SSL certificate
- browser decides the "chain of trust" for you
  - trusted root: 40 CAs in Chrome
  - trusted intermediate: 25 CAs in Chrome


#### 1.5. Certificates

- consists of a public-private key

- known as PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)

- code signing certificates
  - used to sign software (Windows Updates must be signed by Microsoft)
  - signing applications (signed malware?)

- public key = SSL certificate
  - binds with the corresponding private key on the server
  - X.509 certificate

- digital signatures via SSL private key
  - private key can be used to sign a message (signature verification via public key)
    - non-repudiation (confidentiality and integrity)
    - authenticity
  - private key can be used to sign other's public key
    - trust relationship (Verisign signs the cert for Microsoft; aka. Verisign trusts Microsoft)

 
#### 1.6. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)

- hardware / servers
- software
- people / policies / procedures
- end goal: digital certificates
- involves:
  - creation / management / storage
  - distribution
  - revoke (certificate blacklisting)

- CA (signs the third-party's SSL certificate with CA's private key)
  - validation authority (VA)
    - registration and issuance process
  - registration authority (RA)
    - ensure the public key is bound to third-party that requests their SSL certs to be signed


#### 1.7. Who ca become a CA?

- anyone can become a CA as long as you get someone to trust you
- Verisign was the first root CA on the Internet
- map of CAs: `https://www.eff.org/files/colour_map_of_cas.pdf`
- if you become a CA you can issue SSL certs for any website (e.g. DigiNotar)
- you can be lucky and just ask for CA to sign your certificates as `example.com` (even though you don't own `example.com`)
  - no VA (validation Authority in place)
  - find a shady CA and you're good to go


#### 1.8. CAs that got hacked

- attacker signed certificates for popular websites (w/o owning those websites)
- March 2011: Comodo CA 
  - got hacked into multiple times, secured 25% of the Internet
  - claim: `https://pastebin.com/85WV10EL`
- also in 2011: DigiNotar CA (no longer exists on the market)
  - issued rouge `*.googe.com` certificate
  - users in Iran affected
  - claim: `https://pastebin.com/JHZ20PQJ`
- also in 2011: StartCom (rumors)
- also in 2011: GlobalSign (same DigiNotar hacker)
- also in 2011: Verisign (sold the SSL business to Symantec in 2010; secures >50% of the web)


#### 1.9. CAs are hard to trust

- Confidentiality
  - everyone can become a CA nowadays
- Integrity + Authenticity
  - no accountability for CAs
  - CA can sign certs for websites you don't own
