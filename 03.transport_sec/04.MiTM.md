#### 4.1. MITM on HTTPS-enabled websites (caveats)

- browsers have cached HSTS for popular websites (by default)
 - `chrome://net-internals/#hsts`
 - `dynamic_upgrade_mode: FORCE_HTTPS`
- HTTP server redirects to HTTPS typically (`Location: https://example.com`)
  - attacker can still intercept clear-text request and modify the response
  - browser has its own cached DNS records (DNS cache poisoning would not work)
  - `HTTP Strict Transport Security - HSTS` response header set (means no downgrade to HTTP)
- cookies may have `secure` flag set (browser won't send the cookie over clear-text HTTP)
- attacker can intercept HTTPS traffic if they have a CA certificate signed for the target website
  -[DEPRECATED] `HTTP Pubic Key Pinning - HPKP` should prevent attacks via rouge certificates
    1. server presents the certificate hashes to the client
    2. client verifies the signature (checksum) on their end to validate certificate
    3. public keys of root/intermediary CAs can also be be pinned (allow all certs signed by this CA)


#### 4.2. Forced SSL CA cert

- attacker can "force" the end-users to install their own SSL-certificate (CA)
- must be in control of the WiFi Access Point (captive-portal)
  - DHCP / DNS server
- mobile devices requires second-step confirmation 
  - iOS: Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings
  - not possible on >= Android Oreo
- self-signed certificates are not enough in the enterprise world
  - users should not get used to ignoring the SSL cert browser warning


#### 4.3. Tools

- sslstrip (out of date)
  - works together with ARP poisoning attack
  - replace all HTTPS (URLs) to HTTP
  - must be on the same network as the victim
  - HSTS must be deployed to protect against this attack + always redirect to HTTPS
- sslsniff 
  - decrypt TLS/SSL traffic if you have the CA cert
  - requires hacking a CA - LOL :D
- BEAST / CRIME / RC4 (crypto attacks)
