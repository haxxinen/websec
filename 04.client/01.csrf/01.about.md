#### 1.1. What is CSRF vulnerability

- CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) aka "sea surf"
- occurs when a *malicious* third-party page can execute actions on the behalf of other users w/o their  consent/awareness
- attack must be highly targeted (sometimes comes as one-time opportunity)
- attack is based on social-engineering (click-bait, watering hole attacks, social media attacks, phishing)


#### 1.2. How to defeat CSRF tokens

- set the token value to empty/none (e.g. `&token` or `&token=`)
- set the token value to something random or something that has similar format to the original value
- entirely delete the CSRF token
- swap `GET` to `POST` request or the other way around
- entropy analysis
  - can we predict what the next token will be?
  - will CSRF tokens be reused?
- use a valid token generated via our session on the behalf of the victim
  - works only if the token self-validates itself 
    (we may still need to break the signature/HMAC like)
- try to access the CSRF token via JavaScript (requires XSS)
- supply an extra token as parameter pollution (e.g. `&token=<original_value>&token=LOL`)
- check if the CSRF tokens are refreshed after re-authenticating on the website with the same user


#### 1.3. Common usage flow of CSRF tokens

A) server generates CSRF token

B) client receives a copy of the CSRF token

C) user executes (create/update/delete) action and sends the CSRF token along
   - action can have impact on data integrity/availability/confidentiality
   - request can trigger other actions outside the web-app's context (call 3rd party API, etc.)

D) server will try to match received CSRF token with the original value (from point A)
   - intended action will be resumed when comparison is evaluated as `true`


#### 1.4. Protecting against CSRF attacks

- CSRF tokens must always be present in user requests that handle create/update/delete operations  
- read-only requests may supply a CSRF token as part of the URL path (e.g. `https://site.com/user/<resource-id-SHA1>/data/<read-only-SHA1>/secrets.txt`)
- `SameSite` cookie
  - browser will only send the cookies for requests originating from the same domain as the target domain)
  - `Samesite=Strict` might not always send the cookies when needed (random site -> GitHub project URL; while being authenticated on GitHub)
  - not a full replacement for CSRF tokens
- CSRF tokens must always be generated/verified server-side
- the tokens must have decent length (preferably > 8 characters/numbers)
  - `token="csrf_8173"` won't be enough
- HTTP request/response headers can be also used to exchange CSRF tokens (`CSRF-token: P9Zw7DnY`)
- (XHR/Ajax request) CSRF tokens can also be used as cookies (`Set-Cookie: _csrf=P9Zw7DnY`)
- tokens don't necessarily need to be generated for one time use (each positive validation will spawn a new token)
  - has no added security value
  - it is enough to generate one token for every new user-session
- `Referer` or `Origin` header values are not to be trusted as the real source of the request
- if the website is not SSL-enabled CSRF tokens are useless
- web app must be XSS-free to not allow bypass of the CSRF tokens
