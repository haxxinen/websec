#### 1.1. Common HTTP security headers

- `X-XSS-Protection: 1;mode=block`
  - enable Cross-Site-Scripting filters in the browser `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_XSS_AUDITOR`
  - works on reflected XSS only (persistent/DOM XSS still possible)

- `X-Frame-Options: deny` (`allow-from https://site.com` / `sameorigin`)
  - prevents your website to be framed (`<frame>/<iframe>`) by others
  - can be configured via CSP as well `frame-ancestors`

- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src: 'self'`
  - white listing of external resources to prevent XSS

- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
  - `max-age` 
     - tells the browser to communicate via HTTPS for set the period of time
     - when set to `0`, HSTS expires immediately (next request will be sent over HTTP)
     - HTTP will redirect to HTTPS
  - `includeSubDomains`
    - force all subdomain requests to be sent over HTTPS

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - applicable on mime-type of `script` / `style`  
  - `nosniff`: browser will not try to guess the response-content MIME type
    - scenario: 
      - `<script src="https://mysite.com/file.txt"></script>`
      - body response contains JS but response header for `Content-Type: text/plain`
