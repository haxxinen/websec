#### 2.1. About

- header format
  - current: `Content-Security-Policy`
  - deprecated: `X-Content-Security-Policy` and `X-WebKit-CSP`
- works on the principle of resource (media) white listing (can prevent exploitation of XSS)
- can be applied on a variety of resources to improve client-side security (not just `script-src` directive; XSS via `<img>` is still possible)
- can be implemented as `https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/flask-talisman#content-security-policy`
- policy misconfiguration will break the website
- lax configuration may not prevent XSS attacks
- tools: `securityheaders.com` / `csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com` / Nmap scripts for security headers

#### 2.2. Mitigating XSS via CSP - part 1

- XSS exploitation works by taking advantage of the browser's inability to (by default) detect the scripts injected by a third-party and the intended scripts used by the web application (thus `<script src="https://my.evilscript.com/x.js"></script>` is possible)

- CSP allows white listing of web application scripts (and other resources) that are allowed to be loaded/executed in the browser
  - if malicious script is not loaded from white listed location XSS exploitation should not be possible

- allow `<script src="<URL>/script.js">` from `https://apis.google.com` and `'self'` (current domain)
  - HTTP response header: `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com`
  - `script-src` <- directive
  - `'self'` / `https://apis.google.com` <- trusted sources
  - browser will throw an error when trying to load scripts from an untrusted source: `https://my.evilscript.com` (not white listed)

- in-line code should not be present as part of the app's DOM `<html><head></head><body><script>console.log(1);</script></body></html>`
  - load JS from trusted local/CDN files only
  - XSS prevention works only if DOM based in-line scripting is disabled
  - following XSS examples will not execute JS code
  ```
  <img src=x onerror="alert(1)"/>
  <iframe src="x" onload="alert(1)"></iframe>
  <iframe src="javascript:alert(XSS)">
  ```


#### 2.3. Mitigating XSS via CSP - part 2

- try to avoid `unsafe-eval` and `'unsafe-inline'` on `*-src` directives
  - when enabled on `default-src` or `script-src` you should not have in-line DOM scripting elements

- banning in-line code on `'self'` is the biggest advantage of CSP
  - if DOM scripting is not possible to avoid, CSP must have a `nonce`
  - CSP Level2 `nonce` must be applied so that malicious (in-line) code doesn't get executed (some kind of CSRF for scripts)
  - only JS interfaces that contain the `'nonce-<XXXXXXXXXXXX>'` are allowed

- the CSP `nonce` is generated server-side and compared client-side with the `nonce` in the CSP response header

Server-side example:
```
<!-- CSP Level 2 -->
<script nonce="{{ csp_nonce() }}">console.log(123);</script>
```
Note: 
- this is still vulnerable to (DOM) XSS exploitation if attacker controls the contents of `<script>[CONTENT]</script>`
- reflected XSS unless `X-XSS-Protection: 1;mode=block` is not set
- persistent XSS should be blocked as the scripting element does not contain (cannot guess) the CSP `nonce`

CSP response header:
```
Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://ajax.googleapis.com 'nonce-NExPClXOj3hYWrTO'; default-src 'none'
```

Client-side DOM:
```
<script nonce="NExPClXOj3hYWrTO">console.log(123);</script>
```


#### 2.4. CSP lockdown examples

Only own resources can be loaded:
```
Content-Security-Policy: 
	default-src 'none';
	script-src https://cdn.bank.net;
	style-src https://cdn.bank.net;
	img-src https://cdn.bank.net;
	connect-src https://api.bank.com;
	child-src 'self'
```

To load everything over secure HTTP:
```
Content-Security-Policy: 
	default-src https:; 
	script-src https: 'unsafe-inline'; 
	style-src https: 'unsafe-inline'
```
Note: this is prone to XSS as the attacker can load remote JS from any untrusted HTTPS location.


#### 2.5. Directives

Note: 
- the following directives may change from CSP version to CSP version
- it also depends on the browser to support them
- depending on the time of this documentation the directive might be (un)deprecated

The list:
- `default-src` - default fallback for any scripting interfaces (typically: `'self'`)
- `script-src` - restrict where JS can be loaded from
- `style-src`- restrict where CSS can be loaded from
- `base-uri` - restrict `<base>` source
- `img-src` - restrict `<img>` source
- `child-src` - restrict `<frame>` / `<iframe>` source (replaces deprecated `frame-src`)
- `connect-src` - restrict `XHR` / `WebSockets` / `EventSource` sources to talk to
- `font-src` - restrict fonts provider (e.g: `font-src https://themes.googleusercontent.com`)
- `form-action` - restricts URLs where you can submit to via `<form>`
- `frame-ancestors` - restrict who can can embed the page via `<frame>` / `<iframe>` / `<embed>` / `<applet>`
- `media-src` - restrict where video/audio media can be loaded from
- `object-src` - restrict where Flash objects can be loaded from
- `plugin-types` - restrict plugins access
- `report-to` - endpoint to which CSP violations are reported
- `upgrade-insecure-requests` - all URLs will be transformed from `http://` to `https://`
- `block-all-mixed-content`- prevent loading any HTTP resources if page is loaded over HTTPS (works only if `upgrade-insecure-requests` is not set)
- `sandbox` - page will be loaded as if it was loaded inside an `iframe` (unique origin, no form submission)
