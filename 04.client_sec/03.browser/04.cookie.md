#### 4.1. About

- syntax on `Set-Cookie`
```
Set-Cookie: x=value; expires=Tue, 01-Jan-2020 20:20:20 GMT; Max-Age=7777777; path=/; domain=.example.com; secure; httponly
```
- cookie security flags are imperative to protect the integrity and confidentiality of a user's session
- security flags must be applied on session cookies such as `JSESSIONID`, `PHPSESSID`, `session_token`, etc.


#### 4.2. Relevant cookie flags

- `secure` 
  - instructs the browser to only deliver the cookie if page is loaded over secure HTTP
  - has effect if HSTS is enabled and if page is loaded over HTTPS

- `httponly`
  - prevents access via JavaScript `document.cookie` (reduces XSS risk)
  - has effect if HSTS is enabled and if page is loaded over HTTPS

- `samesite=strict` or `samesite=lax` (since Nov. 2017)
  - prevents the cookie to be sent in cross-site browsing context (reduces CSRF risk)
  - scenario for `strict`:
    a. user is authenticated on GitHub
    b. user is surfing Reddit
    c. user cannot trigger any action on GitHub from URLs posted on Reddit (no cookies are ever sent)
  - scenario for `lax`:
    a. user is authenticated on GitHub
    b. user is surfing Reddit
    c. user can go to a GitHub URL from a different context (Reddit) by explicitly clicking on the GitHub URL (XHR/loading of images is not possible)
