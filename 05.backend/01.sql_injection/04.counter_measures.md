#### 4.1. Counter measurements

a) always use prepared statements:
   - PDO (PHP Data Object library + DB connector)
   - MySQLi (MySQL improved)
   - use an ORM (handles all the SQL work for you - how nice of them...)

b) perform user-input validation if option `a)` is not an option:
   – old PHP versions:
     - `mysql_real_escape_string` - escapes MySQL meta-data characters by prepending backslashes (e.g. `\"`, `\'`)
     - `(int) $sum` - cast integer parameters
   - blacklists/whitelists are not bulletproof

c) use stored procedures when necessary (improves DB performance as well):
   - traditional: check syntax, compile, execute and return
   - stored: execute and return

d) encrypt your data before storage; decrypt upon retrieval:
   - encryption key management can get messy
   - even the US gov. leaked SSNs (no surprise there)

e) apply MySQL hardening:
   - avoid displaying DBMS errors – stop using `die(mysql_error())`
   - the webapp database user must have low privileges (CRUD is typically enough)
   - avoid using the file upload function of MySQL (implement a secure file upload at application layer instead)


#### 4.2. Few words on PDO (PHP Data Object) library

Please c/o this gist:
- `https://gist.github.com/anonymous/35a293c10fb39bcf6df6c71db7e8bd79`
- it works like a light ORM (written by me)
- PDO has more flexibility (over MySQLi)

The main idea is to provide the user-supplied data as bind parameters to the SQL query:

```php
private static function executeQueryAndFetchAll($query_string, $params_array) { 
	$query = DB::handler()->prepare($query_string);  // prepare the query string
	$query->execute($params_array);                  // execute the prepared query using the user input
	return $query->fetch(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); 
} 

executeQueryAndFetchAll(
	"SELECT id, email, password, isactive, avatar, description FROM users WHERE email = ?",
	["anon@anon.com"]
);
```

When executing this query, the user input is "passed" to the query template (like arguments to a function). 
This is similar to stored procedures, although not really the same thing - it is the parameterized aspect 
of executing the SQL queries that is the same.
