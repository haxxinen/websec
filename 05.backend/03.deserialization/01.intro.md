#### 1.1. Intro

- serialization is the process of translating a data structure or an object-state into a machine-readable format (`[Object] -> Serialize() -> [Byte-Stream]`)

- de-serialization is the reverse process that converts the translated objects back into the original state (`[Object] <- Deserialize() <- [Byte-Stream]`)

- serialized data appears like some form of packed/byte-stream format of the object-state

- different naming from one programming language to the other (PHP/Java/Python/etc. objects)
  - Java/PHP: `serializing/deserializing`
  - Python: `pickling/unpickling`
  - Ruby: `marshalling/unmarshalling`


#### 1.2. Security involvements

- unsafe de-serialization of untrusted user-input can lead to RCE
  - no input validation on e.g. `unserialize($_COOKIE['data']);` (PHP)
  - requires building a gadget-chain to modify execution flow
  - can only make use of classes/objects used as dependency chain of the app
  - relatively difficult to exploit

- user-sessions can also contain serialized data (PHP)
```
From: a:4:{i:0;i:132;i:1;s:7:"Mallory";i:2;s:4:"user";i:3;s:32:"b6a8b3bea87fe0e05022f8f3c88bc960";}
To: a:4:{i:0;i:1;i:1;s:5:"Alice";i:2;s:5:"admin";i:3;s:32:"b6a8b3bea87fe0e05022f8f3c88bc960";}
```
- may lead to privilege escalation in the app via object attributes (use JWT instead)


#### 1.3. Attack surface

- remote (`client<->server`) and internal communication (`server<->server`)
- web-services / APIs, message brokers & message queuing systems
- permanent/temporary persistence, databases
- HTTP cookies, API authorization tokens


#### 1.4. General mitigation

- avoid processing serialized objects from untrusted user-input
- use a more trusted (de)serialization mechanisms such as JSON encoding/decoding
