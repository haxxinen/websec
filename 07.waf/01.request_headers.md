#### 1.1. About

Proxy headers to bypass WAFs:
```
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Real-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-Host: 127.0.0.1
X-Requested-With: 127.0.0.1
Z-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded: 127.0.0.1
Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
Cluster-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
True-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
```

#### 1.2. Concept

- allows spoofing of trusted IP addresses
- end-point/server/API/WAF might allow "pass-through" access
- requires some research about internal IP addresses
  - Docker default: `172.17.0.1-254`
  - company guest/corporate network (external/internal IP)
